## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text http://paletton.com/

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=13z0u0klllluOHPsyzve89wkV6p
Your Rationale: Blue is the color of intelligence, making it a trustworthy color. While being darker, it appeals to the more common "dark mode" that many gamers prefer, while looking fantastic.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=52e0t0kw0qVPPa6K3eTkA-Wazuu
Your Rationale: I used this palette as I wanted to incorporate the green color that Botanical Gardens uses for their logo/website. Feels like Spring in my opinion!

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=35w0%2B0koYs7EQc5x-gNecFS6cvm
Your Rationale: When I think of kid shows, I often think of the primary colors being the go to. I didn't want to go for the direct primaries, and the colors are a bit less saturated because I was thinking of a ball pit, where the colors of the balls the kids play in are not super bright.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=b3P4i3m0knjuIzlfUuOkicsMK4hEx
Your Rationale: When I think cybersecurity, I often think of a dark, locked down color space, which is what inspired me to make this color palette.
